- statistics: distribution data 
	- shoemaker - avg shoe size
	- reduces data to e.g. avg value
- statistics -> machine learning
	- ML mostly deals w/ distributions (e.g. distribution of shoe sizes)
	- e.g. normal/bell-curve-gaussian
	- using ML to find distribution and mean/standard deviation thru fitting
	- taking a lot of practical observations, measurements and finding distribution
	- for this we don't need a lot of compute - majority of operations require just summation/division/multiplication
